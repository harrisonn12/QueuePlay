My favorite sports are soccer, basketball, and MMA. But seeing Ohtani Shohei was unforgettable!

I love trying out new places to eat. Sushi is my favorite food, so I was on a search to find the best sushi during my solo trip in Japan.

<Small>Surfing</Small>

I love surfing, and it is a recent hobby of mine to go out to the ocean and surf. I hope to learn how to bottom turn in the near future.

I love traveling because I can immerse myself in different cultures and sights. Some of my favorites places I have been to are Jamaica, Japan, Bahamas, and Brazil. This picture is from Joshua Tree National Park, and it was one of the best sunsets I have seen.
